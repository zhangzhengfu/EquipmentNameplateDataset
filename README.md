# The Equipment Nameplate Dataset for Scene Text Detection and Recognition
## Abstract
In this paper, we introduce the Equipment Nameplate Dataset, a large dataset for scene text detection and recognition. 
Natural images in this dataset are taken in the wild and thus this dataset includes various intra-class inconsistency such as ill illumination conditions and partly occluded, which makes our dataset more challenging than other datasets. 
In order to make people train detection and recognition model separately, we annotate our dataset not only word instance, but also text region by using rectangle bounding boxes. 
Some detailed statistics information about our dataset will be given so that people can use them to analyse and develop their own models. 
Moreover, we use our dataset to test some famous detection and recognition models and present the corresponding results in order to make researcher compare them with their own models.
